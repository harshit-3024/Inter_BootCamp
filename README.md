# Stock Momentum Prediction and Backtesting
This project uses a machine learning model to predict stock momentum and a backtesting framework to evaluate the trading strategy.

## Files
generate_csvs.ipynb: This notebook loads stock data, calculates over 15 technical indicators, and uses an XGBoost model to predict stock momentum. It then saves the top 10 ranked stocks into daily CSV files.

finalv5.ipynb: This notebook runs an intraday backtesting simulation on the ranked stocks generated by generate_csvs.ipynb. It executes trades based on momentum and technical indicators like RSI and ADX to evaluate the strategy's performance.

## Requirements
This project requires Python 3 and the following libraries:

pandas

numpy

yfinance

plotly

scikit-learn

xgboost

ipykernel

nbformat

notebook

jupyter

## Install the necessary libraries using pip:

pip install -r requirements.txt


## Cloning Instructions
To clone this repository, run the following command:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/harshit-3024/Inter_BootCamp.git

## Run Backtest: 
Execute the finalv5.ipynb notebook to run the backtesting simulation on the generated rankings and view the performance results.
